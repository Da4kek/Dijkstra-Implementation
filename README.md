# Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation

>**Dijkstra's algorithm** is designed to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

*Dijkstra's algorithm works on undirected, connected, weighted graphs.*

### Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm:
---
It is an iterative algorithm that provides shortest path from one node to all other nodes in the graph. It takes in weight distances known as **Vertex** to estimate the shortest distance between two nodes.

The algorithm implemented using *priority queue or heap queue* by which the order of iteration is controlled.

**implementation.py** is where the algorithm is implemented and showcased, Input/graph can be given in this file.

### Future work:

>This will be used lately on datasets to find correlation/mapping between key features for later neural network intuition and implementation.
